# ðŸŽ“â€¯Student Management System
## ðŸ—‚ Project Overview
This consoleâ€‘based Student Management System lets you collect, analyse, and persist essential data for a small class (upâ€¯toâ€¯30 students, 5 subjects each) using nothing more than standardâ€¯C.
It demonstrates structured data handling with struct, robust string/file I/O, and basic algorithms for search, sort, and statisticsâ€”all packaged in a clear, menuâ€‘driven UI.

## Core Capabilities
|Action                 |	Menu Option |	Process                                                   |
|-----------------------|---------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
|Add Student	        |1	            |Capture name, ID, and 5 subject marks â†’ autoâ€‘compute average.|
|Search by Name	        |2	            |Instant lookup by exact name match.                          |
|Edit Grades	        |3	            |Overwrite a studentâ€™s 5 marks, recalculating the average.    |
|Display All (Sorted)	|4	            |Bubbleâ€‘sort by average (descending) then print a neat roster.|
|Save to File	        |5	            |Persist every record to students.txt (humanâ€‘readable format).|
|Load from File	        |6	            |Reâ€‘hydrate records from students.txt into memory.            |
|Exit	                |7	            |Quit the application gracefully.                             |

## Implementation Highlights
- Data Model â€“ typedef struct Student holding name, ID, five grades, and a cached average.

- String Safety â€“ uses fgets, strncpy_s, strcmp, etc., to avoid buffer overruns.

- File I/O â€“ use safe version function fopen_s plus structured fprintf / fgets / sscanf_s parsing.

- Algorithms â€“ custom bubble sort (descending averages) and linear search by name.

- Defensive Coding â€“ caps on class size, newline stripping, and format validation during load.
